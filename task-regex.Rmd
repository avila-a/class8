# Fun with regular expressions

In this task, you will use the object `data_char_sampletext` and the **stringr** package to extract some quantities.

## Getting the data

This is easy:
```{r}
data("data_char_sampletext", package = "quanteda")
```

## Regex challenges

Hints: use `str_extract_all()`, `str_replace_all()` from the **stringr** package.  For some of these you should examine the [Unicode character categories](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/index.htm) or the older-style POSIX character classes (see `?`regular expression``).

1.  Extract the numbers.  Figure out the regular expression code to represent numbers.

2.  Extract the currency references followed by numbers.  You can either list the currency symbols or use a Unicode category for this, followed by a numeric category.

3.  Extract the all-capitalized terms.

4.  Extract the capitalized (title case) terms.

5.  Extract terms that end in "s".

6.  Replace the € currency symbol with the £ symbol.

7.  Extract all terms starting or ending with "y".
